Context: This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Task: Predict the class of iris plant.

Questions to Answer:
• Perform EDA and Explore the features using histograms
• Encode the target variable ie convert it to numeric type
• Experiment using two different ratios of training, validation and test data ie 60-20-20, 80-10-10. On the two different split ratios do the following
    o Implement KFold Cross Validation
    o Implement Grid Search to find optimal hyperparameters for any 3 algorithms (out of LR, SVM, MLP, RF, Boosting)
    o Analyze the results on Validation set and test set and mention which model performed the best and why?
    o Compare the performance of models(using precision, recall, accuracy, latency). What was the best proportion or split ratio of data from the set of experiments you conducted?

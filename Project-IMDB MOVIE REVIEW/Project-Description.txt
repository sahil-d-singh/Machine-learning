Context: IMDB dataset having 25K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. 
We provide a set of 12,500 highly polar movie reviews for training and 12,500 for testing.

Task: Goal of this project is to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using classification

Implementation:
- Preprocess Text Data(Remove punctuation, Perform Tokenization, Remove stopwords and Lemmatize/Stem)
- Perform TFIDF Vectorization
- Exploring parameter settings using GridSearchCV on Random Forest & Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Perform Final evaluation of models on the best parameter settings using the evaluation metrics
- Report the best performing model
